## A Little About Me
 I'm a self-confessed lifelong learner, that has been able to study an eclectic range of subjects.
 From two Business degree; and a Chemistry degree; to a coding bootcamp.

 I've been working in digital marketing since 2010, primarily  Email Marketing and Online Lead Generation (through sponsored surveys), I've now made the move over to programming the systems I once used.

## My Education

### **Makers Academy**

In my ambition to develop a wider knowledge base of digital marketing and become a Software Developer, I completed the intensive 12 week [Makers Academy] bootcamp, which I did remotely, from July 2016 to September 2016.
[Makers Academy]: http://www.makersacademy.com/


 Below are a few of my projects from the course.

|Project Name| What's it about| Technolgies used|
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [My Rock-Paper-Scissors Web App](https://github.com/BJudge/rps-challenge)|A Web app of Rock, Paper, Scissors, that has a random function that acts as player 2/computer. I particularly liked making this as I was able to understand how the follow function works on social networking sites.|Ruby, Sinatra,HTML, CSS, Rspec, Capybara|
|[Cocktales](https://github.com/Cocktales/cocktales)|This was the final project I did at Makers Academy, or more precisely a passion project that [Samed] (https://github.com/SamedYalniz), [Joe] (https://github.com/joesweeny), [Oggie] (https://github.com/ogirginc) and myself worked on. This lacks the follow function I hadn't learn yet from the Instagram clone|RSpec, Ruby on Rails, Capybara, postgresql, Active Record,HTML & CSS|

#### Post-Course objectives
I plan on continuing to develop my programming skills by learning Go and Python, during my spare time.

### Open Universtiy Studies

#### - Business Degree - 2.1
#### - M.B.A
#### - Chemsitry Degree (240 points), where I received a merit for my second year.



## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partial to the odd sport or two.

 When time allows I like Boxing and Judo, however I did train as a powerlifter for close to 12 years.

 Having seen a friend compete in their first bodybuilding competition (September 2016), I have been inspired to enter one myself in 2017- <b> Instagram account to follow!! </b>
