## A Little About Me
 As a self-confessed lifelong learner, and a fitness fanatic, I have been able to pursue an eclectic range of interests and opportunities.

 From working in digital marketing since 2010 (Email Marketing and Online Lead Generation), to a part-time chemistry degree and years of powerlifting; Judo; and boxing.  

## My Education

###**Makers Academy**

In my ambition to become a Software Developer, I completed the intensive 12 week <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank"> Makers Academy </a> bootcamp, which I did remotely, from July 2016 to September 2016.


 Below are a few of my projects from the course:


 | Project Name| What's it about| Technologies used|
 |_____________| _______________| _________________|
 | [My Instagram Clone](https://github.com/BJudge/Final-Instagram)| A clone of the photo sharing site, I particularly liked making this as I was able to understand how the follow function works on social networking sites.| Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Rspec, Capybara|  
 |[Cocktales](https://github.com/Cocktales/cocktales)| This was the final project I did at Makers Academy, or more precisely a passion project that [Samed] (https://github.com/SamedYalniz), [Joe] (https://github.com/joesweeny), [Oggie] (https://github.com/ogirginc) and myself worked on. This lacks the follow function I hadn't learn yet from the Instagram clone| Rspec, Ruby, |
 | TBC                                  |          tbc                      | tbc               |
## My Experience

### Final Project

Cocktales, was a passion project that [Samed] (https://github.com/SamedYalniz), [Joe] (https://github.com/joesweeny), [Oggie] (https://github.com/ogirginc) and myself worked on, as our final project for Makers Academy.
I utilised the following skill
 - Test Driven Developement
 - RSpec
 - Ruby on Rails
 - Capybara
 - postgreSQL
 - Active Record
 - HTML & CSS


Before Makers Academy I was a prolific Open University student. <br>
Having studied a fair few subjects, such as; <br>
  - BA in Business Studies 2.1
  - MBA
  - BSc Chemistry <b> merit </b> (the first two years)
 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>



## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partial to the odd sport or two.

 Having seen a friend compete in their first bodybuilding competition, I have been inspired to enter one in 2017- <b> Instagram account to follow!! </b>
