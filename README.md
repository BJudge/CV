## A Little About Me

I'm a self-confessed lifelong learner, that has been able to study an eclectic range of subjects.

I've been working in digital marketing since 2010, primarily Email Marketing and Online Lead Generation (through sponsored surveys), I've now made the move over to programming the systems I once used.

## My Education

### **Makers Academy**

In my ambition to develop a wider knowledge base of digital marketing and become a Software Developer, I completed the intensive 12 week [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) bootcamp, which I did remotely, from August 2016 to November 2016.

Below are a few of my projects from the course.

| [Rock-Paper-Scissors Web App](https://github.com/BJudge/rock-paper-scissors-improved) | A web-app of Rock, Paper, Scissors, that has a random function that acts as player 2/computer. I particularly liked making this as I was able to understand singleton classes and how to store instance variables without sessions or databases.           | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Capybara                  | [On Heroku](https://bart-rps.herokuapp.com/)       |
| [Airport Application](https://github.com/BJudge/airport_challenge)                    | My first weekend challenge, with the key skill being able to abstract airport(s); plane(s); and random weather into classes.                                                                                                                               | Ruby, Rspec                                                |
| [Natours App](https://github.com/BJudge/natours)                                      | An Express API connecting to a vanilla Javascript front end, using mapbox, SendGrd, and a Stripe webhook to add additional functionality. This was done as a walkthrough from a Udemy course. existing users can log in and purchase one of nine holidays. | Node, Express, Pug, Vanilla Javascript, MongoDB            | [On Heroku](https://travel-site-app.herokuapp.com) |
