## A Little About Me
 A self-confessed lifelong learner, and a fitness fanatic, has given me the opportunity to pursue an eclectic range of interests.

 From working in digital marketing since 2010, to a part-time chemistry degree and years of powerlifting; Judo; and boxing.  



## My Education

In my ambition to become a Software Developer, I have completed the intensive 12 week <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank"> Makers Academy </a> bootcamp, which I did remotely from the coast of Kent.

Before Makers Academy I was an Open University addict. <br>
Having studied a fair few subjects, such as; <br>
 - BA in Business Studies
 - MBA
 - BSc Chemistry (the first two years)

 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>





## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partail to the odd sport or two.
