## A Little About Me




## My Education
I have completed the intensive 12 week <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank"> Makers Academy </a>, which I did remotely from the coast of Kent.

 As an Open University addict, I have studied a fair few subjects. <br>
 Starting with a Business Degree. and then an MBA. <br>
 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>





## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partail to the odd sport or two.
Instagram account to follow!!
