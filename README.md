## A Little About Me

I'm a self-confessed lifelong learner, that has been able to study an eclectic range of subjects.

I've been working in digital marketing since 2010, primarily Email Marketing and Online Lead Generation (through sponsored surveys), I've now made the move over to programming the systems I once used.

## My Education

### **Makers Academy**

In my ambition to develop a wider knowledge base of digital marketing and become a Software Developer, I completed the intensive 12 week [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) bootcamp, which I did remotely, from August 2016 to November 2016.

Below are a few of my projects from the course.
