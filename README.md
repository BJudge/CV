## A Little About Me
 As a self-confessed lifelong learner, and a fitness fanatic, I have been able to pursue an eclectic range of interests and opportunities.

 From working in digital marketing since 2010 (Email Marketing and Online Lead Generation), to a part-time chemistry degree and years of powerlifting; Judo; and boxing.

## My Education

In my ambition to become a Software Developer, I have completed the intensive 12 week <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" target="_blank"> Makers Academy </a> bootcamp, which I did remotely from the coast of Kent.

Before Makers Academy I was an Open University addict. <br>
Having studied a fair few subjects, such as; <br>
  - BA in Business Studies 2.1
  - MBA
  - BSc Chemistry (the first two years) merit

 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>



## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partial to the odd sport or two.
