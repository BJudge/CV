|Project Name| What's it about| Technolgies used|
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| [My Instagram Clone](https://github.com/BJudge/Final-Instagram)|A clone of the photo sharing site, I particularly liked making this as I was able to understand how the follow function works on social networking sites.|Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Postgresql, Rspec, Capybara|
|Cocktales](https://github.com/Cocktales/cocktales)|This was the final project I did at Makers Academy, or more precisely a passion project that [Samed] (https://github.com/SamedYalniz), [Joe] (https://github.com/joesweeny), [Oggie] (https://github.com/ogirginc) and myself worked on. This lacks the follow function I hadn't learn yet from the Instagram clone|RSpec, Ruby on Rails, Capybara, postgresql, Active Record,HTML & CSS|





## My Experience

### Final Project

Cocktales, was a passion project that [Samed] (https://github.com/SamedYalniz), [Joe] (https://github.com/joesweeny), [Oggie] (https://github.com/ogirginc) and myself worked on, as our final project for Makers Academy.
I utilised the following skill
 - Test Driven Developement
 - RSpec
 - Ruby on Rails
 - Capybara
 - postgreSQL
 - Active Record
 - HTML & CSS


Before Makers Academy I was a prolific Open University student. <br>
Having studied a fair few subjects, such as; <br>
  - BA in Business Studies 2.1
  - MBA
  - BSc Chemistry <b> merit </b> (the first two years)
 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>



## Hobbies and Interests
 When Im not immersed in self-study, I'm partial to the odd sport or two.

 Having seen a friend compete in their first bodybuilding competition, I have been inspired to enter one in 2017- <b> Instagram account to follow!! </b>
