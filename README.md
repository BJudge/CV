## <a id="about">A Little About Me</a>




## <a id="education">My Education</a>
 As an Open University addict, I have studied a fair few subjects. <br>
 Starting with a Business Degree. and then an MBA. <br>
 I furthered my passion for learning by starting a Chemistry degree as a part-time, evening hobby, which eventually consumed every spare moment I had. <br>
 While I have only done the first two years of the chemistry degree, I have every intention of finishing it, perhaps evening taking it to masters level. <br>
 I have also complete the intensive 12 week Makers Academy, which I did remotely from the coast of Kent.
